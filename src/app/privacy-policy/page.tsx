            How We Use Your Information
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most
            commonly, we will use your personal data in the following
            circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into
              or have entered into with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
              third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
              override those interests.
            </li>
            <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            <li>
              Where you have provided consent for us to process your personal
              data for a specific purpose.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Data Security</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
            personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
            unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
            to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
            other third parties who have a business need to know.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
            data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
            breach where we are legally required to do so.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Your Legal Rights</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection
            laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
            exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your
            request in these circumstances.
