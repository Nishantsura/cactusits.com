Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes many forms, including slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, and human trafficking, all of which involve the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.Cactus takes a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business dealings and relationships, as well as implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery does not exist anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.We are also committed to ensuring transparency in our own operations and in our approach to combating modern slavery throughout our supply chains, in accordance with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act.We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers, and other business partners, we will continue to include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory, or trafficked labour, as well as anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, in our contracting processes, and we expect our suppliers to hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.This policy applies to all individuals who work for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives, and business partners.This policy is not part of any employee’s employment contract, and we reserve the right to change it at any time.Policy ResponsibilitiesCactus is ultimately responsible for ensuring that this policy conforms with our legal and ethical commitments, as well as that all people under our control abide by it.Cactus is in charge of implementing this policy on a daily basis, monitoring its usage and effectiveness, dealing with any questions about it, and reviewing internal control systems and processes to ensure they are successful in combating modern slavery.Management at all levels is responsible for ensuring that people reporting to them understand and comply with this policy, as well as that they get proper and ongoing training on it and the subject of modern slavery in supply chains.You are welcome to comment on this policy and offer ways to improve it.Any comments, suggestions or queries are encouraged and should be addressed to Director(s).Policy ComplianceYou must read, understand, and enforce this policy.
